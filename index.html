<strong> <h3>Lyrics</h3>
    [Verse 1]:</strong>
<p>
The markings on your surface<br>
Your speckled face<br>
Flawed crystals hang from your ears<br>
I couldn't gauge your fears<br>
I can't relate to my peers<br>
I'd rather live outside<br>
I'd rather chip my pride than lose my mind out here<br>
Maybe I'm a fool<br>
Maybe I should move and settle<br>
Two kids and a swimming pool<br>
I'm not brave (Brave)<br>
I'm not brave</p> <br>
  <strong>[Verse 2]:</strong>
<p>
I'm living over city<br>
And taking in the homeless sometimes, 
I've been living in an idea<br>
An idea from another man's mind<br>
Maybe I'm a fool<br>
To settle for a place with some nice views (Nice views)<br>
Maybe I should move, settle down<br>
Two kids and a swimming pool<br>
I'm not brave<br>
I'd rather live outside<br>
I'd rather live outside<br>
I'd rather go to jail<br>
I've tried hell (It's a loop)<br>
What would you recommend I do? (And the other side of the loop is a loop)<br>
This, this feâ€”, this feel, this feel, this feels<br>
This feels how molly must feel<br>
This feels how molly must feel<br>
How molly must feel<br>
This feels how molly must feel<br>
How molly must feel<br>
 </p>

 <strong>[Bridge]</strong> <br>
<p>

This is not my life<br>
It's just a fond farewell to a friend<br>
It's just a fond farewell to a friend<br>
This is not my life<br>
It's just a fond farewell to a friend<br>
It's not what I'm like<br>
It's just a fond farewell (Brave)<br>
</p>

<strong>[Verse 3]</strong> <br>
<p>
Speaking of Nirvana, it was there <br>
Rare as the feathers on my dash from a phoenix  <br>
There with my crooked teeth and companion sleeping, yeah  <br>
Dreaming a thought that could dream about a thought <br>
That could think of the dreamer that thought <br>
That could think of dreaming and getting a glimmer of God <br>
I be dreaming of dreaming a thought <br>
That could dream about a thought <br>
That could think of dreaming a dream <br>
Where I cannot, where I cannot  <br>
</p>

<strong>[Verse 4]</strong> <br>
<p>
Less morose and more present <br>
Dwell on my gifts for a second, a moment <br>
One solar flare, we're consumed <br>
So why not spend this flammable paper on the film that's my life? <br>
High flights, inhale the vapor, exhale once and think twice <br>
Eat some shrooms, maybe have a good cry about you <br>
See some colors, light hang glide off the moon <br>
</p>
<strong>[Outro]</strong> <br>
In the dark, in the dark
I'd do anything for you (In the dark) <br>
I'd do anything for you (In the dark) <br>
I'd do anything for you (In the dark) <br>
I'd do anything for you (In the dark) <br>
I'd do anything for you, anything for you (In the dark) <br>
I'd do anything for you, anything for you (In the dark) <br>
